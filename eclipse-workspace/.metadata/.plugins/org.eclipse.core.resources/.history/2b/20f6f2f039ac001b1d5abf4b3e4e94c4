/* Identifiers:
A name in java program is called identifier, which can be used for identification purpose. 
It can be Method, variable name, class name or label name

eg: LanguageFundamentals, main, string,args,x are identifiers in the below code

Rules & regulations:
1. The only allowed characters in java identifiers are : a to z, A to Z, 0 to 9, $, _ 
   we will get compile time error if we are using any character eg: total#
2. Identifiers can not starts with numeric numbers  eg :123total - not allowed but total123 allowed
3. Java identifiers are case sensitive eg : number, Number,NUMBER are different and allowed
4. No length limit for java identifiers but it is not recommended 
5. Reserved words/Keywords are not allowed eg: int if = 20 , is not allowed
6. All predefined class name and interface name are allowed to used as identifiers but not recommended 
   because it reduces readability and create confusion
