/* 1 - Identifiers:
A name in java program is called identifier, which can be used for identification purpose. 
It can be Method, variable name, class name or label name

eg: LanguageFundamentals, main, string,args,x are identifiers in the below code

Rules & regulations:
1. The only allowed characters in java identifiers are : a to z, A to Z, 0 to 9, $, _ 
   we will get compile time error if we are using any character eg: total#
2. Identifiers can not starts with numeric numbers  eg :123total - not allowed but total123 allowed
3. Java identifiers are case sensitive eg : number, Number,NUMBER are different and allowed
4. No length limit for java identifiers but it is not recommended 
5. Reserved words/Keywords are not allowed eg: int if = 20 , is not allowed
6. All predefined class name and interface name are allowed to used as identifiers but not recommended 
   because it reduces readability and create confusion

/*	2 - Reserved Keywords (53))
 
 in java some words are reserved to represent to meaningful functionality,such types of words 
 are called reserved words
 
 Keywords - 50 ( reserved word associated with functionality)
 Reserved literals - 3 (true,false,null) 

							Reserved Keywords (53)

				Keywords - 50                         Reserved literals - 3 
			/				\								- true
used keywords(48)        unused keywords(2)					- false

keywords for Data types:8
	- byte, short,int, long, float, double, boolean, char

Keywords for flow control:11
	-if, else, do, while, switch, case, default, for, break, continue, return
	
Keywords for modifiers:11
	- public, private, protected,static, final,abstract, synchronized, native, transient, volatile, strictfp(1.2v)

Keywords for exception handling: 6
	- try, catch,finally,throw,throws,assert(1.4)

Keywords for class: 6
	- class,extends, interface, implements, package, import
	
Keywords for objects: 4
	-new, instanceof,super,this

 - void
 - enum (1.5) use enum to define a grouped constants eg: month, beer
 
 conclusions:
 - all 53 reserved words contains only alphabetic
 - all are used small letters
 - No delete because Garbage collector is used for destruction
